## Простой проект калькулятор квадратных уравнений с небольшим UI интерфейсом
#### Mandatory part
#### Write a program that solves a polynomial second or lower degree equation. You will have
#### to show at least:
#### • The equation in its reduced form.
#### • The degree of the equation.
#### • It’s solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sens.
#### We will always expect the entry to have the right format, ie. every term respect theform a ∗ x. Exponents are organized and present. Beware, it doesn’t mean the equationhas a solution! If so, your program should detect it and specify it. You should also thinkof zero, negative or non whole coefficients... There might be exceptions you will have to manage. In the equation 42∗X0 = 42∗X0 for instance, each real number is a solution...
